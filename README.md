# SpillGuard 🌊🚨

SpillGuard is an early-stage prototype of a **dam spillage alert and relief coordination system**.  
It is inspired by the October 2023 Akosombo Dam spillage disaster in Ghana, which displaced thousands of families — including my own.  

## 📌 Features
- Real-time **alerts** for dam spillage events  
- **Relief coordination system** for displaced families  
- **Database** of affected communities and support requests  
- Future integration with **mobile app + AI tools**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Flask prototype backend)  
- MySQL (for storing alerts and relief data)  
- Figma (UI mockups for mobile app)  

## 🚀 How to Run (Prototype)
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
